    <h1>The Robotics Club - History and Mission</h1>

    <p>
      The Robotics Club was founded in 2010 by a group of passionate engineering
      students with a shared interest in robotics and innovation. Our mission is
      to provide a platform for students to explore the exciting world of
      robotics, develop their technical skills, and contribute to the
      advancement of robotics technology.
    </p>

    <p>
      Since our inception, the club has grown significantly, attracting students
      from various engineering disciplines. We have participated in numerous
      regional and national robotics competitions, achieving remarkable success
      and consistently pushing the boundaries of robotic design and
      functionality.
